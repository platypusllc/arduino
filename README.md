Platypus Arduino Library
========================

> Warning: This library is still in development.  Please do not use this yet for any active projects.

The Platypus Arduino Library provides a standard library for interacting with Platypus Arduino-based hardware, such as the Platypus Controller.

### Installation ###

Download [this repository](https://github.com/PlatypusLLC/Arduino/archive/master.zip) and extract it into a folder named `Platypus` in the `libraries` sub-directory of your sketchbook directory.  You may need to create the `libraries` directory if this is your first library.

After restarting the Arduino IDE, you should now see **Platypus** under **Sketch > Import > Library**  directory inside of the libraries sub-directory of your sketchbook directory.

### Usage ###

You can use this library to configure your own Platypus Controller firmware.  Take a look at the [examples](examples) directory for some basic configurations.
